Given a lower and an upper limit, calculate the number of prime numbers in the range. (Both upper and lower limits inclusive)

Input:
The number of test cases t
The following t lines contains two integers L and U.

Output:
For each test case, print the number of primes in the range

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 100
1 <= L <= 10^6
1 <= U <= 10^6

Example:
Input:
2
1 10
12 20

Output:
4
3
