Attention!

Its Republic Day and the college is organising a parade. A parade can be successful only if the gap between consecutive students remains constant. Considering the position of the leader at 0 and given the positions of all students, check whether the parade is successful or not.
Assume only one single queue exists in the parade. Also assume that no two students can occupy the same position.

Input:
First line of input contains an integer P denoting the number of parades. 
Each of the following P lines contains an integer S - the number of students participating in the parade.
The following S number of integers denote the position 'd' of each student in the line with respect to the leader.

Constraints:
1 <= P <= 100
1 <= S <= 1000
1 <= d <= 1000000

Output:
For each test case, output YES if the parade is successful and NO if the parade is not.


Example:

Input:
2
5
2 4 6 8 10
4
1 3 5 8

Output:
YES
NO
