Fire Escape!

Apex Block is on fire! Given the number of classes and the number of students in each class, calculate the total number of students who would be escaping.
Assume that no student wishes to die. :P

Input:
First line contains the number of test cases t
Each test case would contain N, the number of classes in Apex Block
The next N lines contains the number of students in each class 'p'.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= p <= 1000

Output:
For each test case, output the total number of students escaping.


Example:
Input:
2
3
63 12 154
4
47 53 31 65

Output:
229
196
