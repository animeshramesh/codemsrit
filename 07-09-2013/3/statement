Crash!!

Consider two cars located at points A and B. The cars start moving towards each other and there's a head-on collision at point C.
Given the distance between A and B as 'D' and their individual speeds S1 and S2, print the distance between A and C 

Assume the following:
D > 0
All distances are in metres
S1 and S2 are measured in metres/second
S1 is the speed of the car at A and S2 is the speed of the car at point B
D, S1 and S2 are integers

Input:
Th number of test cases t.
The following t lines contain 3 integers each. 
D S1 S2

Constraints:
t <= 100
D <= 10^5
S1,S2 <= 100

Output:
For each test case, output a single line printing the distance between A and C in metres.
Print 4 digits after the decimal.

Example:
Input:
2
100 10 20
100 20 10

Output:
33.33
66.67
