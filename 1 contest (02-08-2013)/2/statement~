Sesuke Uchiha is one of the most intelligent pupil in hidden leaf village. While preparing for math’s exam he noticed that his math notes is full of ink blots. 
He knows it is obviously done by his best friend Naruto Uzumarki.  Sesuke developed a technique which replaces all ink blots by the string “codemsrit”.
Here is a Sesuke’s book processed with his new technique. Your task is to recover his notes, which were used to practice some addition problems on 
positive integers.

INPUT
First like contains number of test cases T<=100 . Each test case is preceded by blank line.

OUTPUT
Output must represent a same equation from test case with all missing digits filled in
                                                  Example
Input:
2

8 + codemsrit = 27

codemsrit18 + 15678 = 17096

Output:

8+19=27
1418+15678=17096

NOTE : Only one part of the equation replaced by the string "codemsrit"
