Team 7 reunites after fourth great Shinobi world war. On Kakashi's insistence and Naruto's crave for Ramen, Sasuke agrees to go with them to Ichiraku's.<br>
While Naruto digs into the ramen bowl right away, Sasuke sits there and wonders how many swirls exist in each pork chop in the ramen bowl. 
To his amazement, number of swirls vary from one chop to another. Sasuke plans to become stronger than Naruto by creating a scroll which can 
help him determine the number of swirls in each chop without looking at it but by just holding it in hand & estimating the diameter!
